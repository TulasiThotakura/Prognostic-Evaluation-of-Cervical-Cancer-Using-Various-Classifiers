# Abstract

This research focuses on predicting cervical cancer using multiple machine learning classifiers 
to identify early-stage malignancy. The study analyzed 858 patient records with 36 attributes 
to evaluate models such as SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.  
SVM and AdaBoost achieved 100% accuracy, showcasing the power of ML in healthcare diagnostics.
