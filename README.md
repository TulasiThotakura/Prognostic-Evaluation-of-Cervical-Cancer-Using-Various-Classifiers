# Prognostic-Evaluation-of-Cervical-Cancer-Using-Various-Classifiers

 Cervical HPV (human papillomavirus) infection 
is almost invariably the prominent reason for cervical cancer. 
The most prevalent malignancy in female is cervical cancer and 
it substantially affects the risk factor for mortality. Cervical 
cancer is bound by a wide range of risk factors. Analyzing risk 
factors from each patient's medical history and screening 
outcomes, we created a prediction model in this study to forecast 
the course of cervical cancer patients. Early detection and 
diagnosis are the most effective methods of lowering the 
incidence of cervical cancer globally since it is a condition that 
is largely preventable. Early detection of the signs of this 
gynecologic disease can be challenging, particularly in nations 
without screening systems. Machine learning techniques can be 
utilized to identify malignant cancerous cells when cervical 
cancer was first discovered. We created a machine-learning 
technique that can handle massive volumes of data concurrently 
with greater accuracy. Based upon many parameters, such as 
age and lifestyle, can forecast a person's likelihood of developing 
cervical cancer. A Kaggle data repository Cervical Cancer 
dataset was retrieved, it had eight hundred and fifty-eight 
unique data sets from distinct cases involving thirty-six variants 
comprised of diverse risk and protective factors. And it had four 
types of attributes: Cytology, Hinselmann, Biopsy, and Schiller. 
Using these class attributes as a basis, this dataset was divided 
into four groups. To detect cancer and facilitate prompt 
identification, ML classification algorithms like Decision Trees 
(DT), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RT), Support 
vector machines (SVM), AdaBoost, and artificial neural 
networks have been implemented. After gathering the data, in 
order to investigate the prevalence of characteristics and 
interconnections between numerous unrelated parameters and 
the propensity to acquire cervical malignancy, we first carried 
out a descriptive statistical study. According to the study's 
inferences, appropriate network architecture, categorization, 
and ML algorithms are capable of properly and effectively 
detecting Cervical Cancer in its early stages utilizing diagnostic 
information. Eventually, while comparing the acquired 
outcomes, we scrutinized that SVM, AdaBoost, DT, and LR 
algorithms had exhibited hundred percentage of performance, 
while RF and ANN algorithms seemed to have ninety-nine 
percentage of performance. Since the goal of our research was 
an early cancer forecast. Than such, we suggest that future 
research should take into account expanding patient histories, 
for example, by integrating primary health information before 
hospital referral.
